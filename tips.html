    <h2>General Tips and Tricks</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Glue fins carefully. Sometimes, an issue with the fins is that their tabs are too short, so it’s impossible to make them stick to the motor tube. See the video at <a href="https://www.apogeerockets.com/Advanced_Construction_Videos/Rocketry_Video_351">https://www.apogeerockets.com/Advanced_Construction_Videos/Rocketry_Video_351</a> to fix this issue.</li>
        <li>If the fin rests diagonally on the motor tube, it might be due to the shock cord’s presence on the motor tube which might prevent the fin from resting all the way, resulting in only two contact points between the fin and the inner tube: on the shock cord and the back of the tube. Instead, sand the part of the fin tab where the shock cord is so the bottom looks something like a stair. Then, the longer part (before the stair) will rest on the inner tube and the stair will sit atop the shock cord.</li>
        <li>Re-use parts from old rockets. Rail buttons or launch lugs are re-usable, as are parachutes, fire blankets, shock cord, nose cones, and more.</li>
        <li>If the motor is not fitting into your inner tube, then sand the inside of the inner tube, as it’s likely that the tube was slightly crumpled or tilted in such a way that the motors can’t fit inside. Sanding it down will let the motor go up.</li>
        <li>Mass every part of the rocket individually to see if any of them are changing and to better identify the cause.</li>
        <li>If the part of your rocket with a lower diameter than the other half also has rail buttons or launch lugs attached, the rocket won’t slide onto the rod because the other half of the rocket prevents it. In that case, use longer screws, and then you can stack the black rail button pieces atop each other to extend the rail buttons far enough away from the body of the rocket to make the rocket fly. These black rail buttons can be harvested from a previous rocket.</li>
        <li>Use launch lugs if you can. They - when popping off - won’t render you unable to fly because of the rail button needing to be installed during the inner tube installation, and their positioning can be modified easier. They are also more sturdy than the thinner, smaller rail buttons.</li>
        <li>When inserting the Kevlar fire blanket, change the location of the hole through which the shock cords go through. If this hole is in the middle of the fire blanket, it will become much harder to position it such that the fire blanket is completely in front of the inner tube and blocking the motor completely, since the shock cord also comes from the inner tube. Instead, by placing the fire blanket hole that the shock cord comes through on the edge of the fire blanket, it’s easier to cover the inner tube motor hole completely.</li>
        <li>When 3-D printing your fins, always increase up the fin tab length by 0.1 cm. It won’t take long to sand away, and because softwares like RockSim/OpenRocket often truncate or round the length, a desired 2.34 cm tab length might actually come out as a 2.3 cm tab length, which would be shorter than desired.</li>
        <li>Use quality centering rings that fit nicely in your body tube so that they are less likely to break from thrust, and so that they have more points of contact with the outer rocket diameter.</li>
        <li>Build an altimeter sled: it will ensure that the altimeter doesn’t move around too much. This isn’t necessary, but it is helpful! If no time, though, just taping the altimeter to the transition works too.</li>
        <li>If the motor you are using may not be the best for your rocket because the apogee on RockSim/OpenRocket or elsewhere isn’t the ideal, use a bigger (29 mm) inner tube in the actual rocket. Then, if using a 24 mm motor, build a motor adapter like an altimeter sled that goes from a 24 mm inner diameter to a 29 mm outer diameter and slide this into the back of the rocket as well.</li>
        <li>Leave the foam nose cone un-spray painted. The paint on a foam nose cone will simply add mass; and it generally cracks and peels off and leaves the front of the nose cone irregularly shaped and slightly damaged.</li>
        <li>Tape the nose cone on. If the nose cone pops off, teams run the risk of disqualification in TARC, and it doesn’t add much mass to the rocket. Also, generally don’t use electrical tape for this because when peeling off the tape, the nose cone generally loses foam that sticks to the tape.</li>
        <li>Launch equipment sometimes fails. If there’s no continuity but the igniter clips are placed correctly, it’s likely that the wire has been fraying. To fix this issue relatively quickly (without a soldering iron, since people don’t often have soldering irons when launching in the field), strip the wire using a pair of scissors or an exacto knife. Push the copper tips through the hole in the igniter clasp and pull them over the end to form a knot to better establish the connection. Wrap entirely with electrical tape.</li>
        <li>Use a launch rod standoff to prevent the rocket’s igniter wires from shorting or touching each other.</li>
        <li>Pennies are a good mass item as they’re heavy (averaging 2.5 grams) and they fit perfectly in the hole at the top of the nose cone.</li>
        <li>Video-tape launches! Even if you miss something when launching, the video won’t.</li>
        <li>Mass objects in real life and compare them to simulated masses - for example, the weight of epoxy or a potential mistake in typing up masses could cause the mass of the rocket to not be the same as the mass in a simulator.</li>
        <li>The rocket liftoff velocity must be greater than 35 mph for it to be safe.</li>
        <li>Treed rockets are common; deal with this by placing the rod for launch location in the part of a launching field farthest from the direction of the wind. When the rocket is descending, it’s likely to move with the wind and thus into the edges of the launching field, which might be marked with trees or other natural barriers that can catch your rocket and hurt it.</li>
        <li>Once your rocket is treed, however, there are a few things you can do. Generally, we use a long pole to try and hook the shock cord around and then pull it down. Climbing up into the trees and shaking the branches can also help. If the fin can of the rocket is low enough to grab and the rocket is stuck because of the shock cord, untie the shock cord and get the fin can down safely and deal with the other (less hard to make) half falling out of the tree.</li>
        <li>When cutting plastic transitions, the fastest and cleanest way is to use a razor saw or hack-saw. Clean up the edges with sandpaper.</li>
        <li>In regards to ordering parts, order everything in advance, as parts arrival time can take a while and that shouldn’t be a hindrance to rocket creation.</li>
        <li>Painting a rocket and letting it dry in such a way that the paint doesn’t drip onto one half of the rocket more than the other (because the rocket is tilted on its pitch axis) can be done in a variety of ways.</li>
