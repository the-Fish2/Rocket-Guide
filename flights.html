    <h2>Flights</h2>
    <h3>Straight Flights</h3>
    <p>Up and down. Nice! If this is the case, check out the altitudes section.</p>

    <h3>Parabola Flights</h3>
    <p>The rocket curves gently in its flight, being diverted from its initial course.</p>
    <p>This is generally seen with the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Curved flight</li>
        <li>Lower apogee than to be expected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To diagnose, consider the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Was the rocket flying into the wind, as in, was it turning such that the wind is going to the left and the rocket begins moving to the right?</li>
    
    <p>This is known as ‘weathercocking.’ All external forces are enacted on the center of pressure. When the wind hits the center of pressure (which should be below the center of gravity), the rocket swings around the center of gravity (as a pivot point) and thus the rocket points into the wind, and the motor thrust pushes it in this direction.</p>
    <p>This can occur when the rocket is too unstable (rocket cannot swing back easily to correct itself; consider that torque is dependent on radius and with CP close to CG it will take more force to return to equilibrium, or it oscillates more - covered in Zigzag flights) or too stable (center of pressure swings around further).</p>
    <p>To fix this, there are several modes of action:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to only fly in ideal weather conditions (wind)</li>
        <li>Use a longer rod</li>
        <li>Make the rocket longer</li>
        <li>Sweep the fins aft</li>
        <li>Airfoil your fins</li>
        <li>Tilt your launch rod into the wind</li>
    </ul>
        <p> </p>
    
        <li>Was there “no wind” - as in, practically no wind at ground level (but the rocket is having a parabolic flight in different directions)?</li>
        <p>Ideally, these are the weather conditions you would want to fly under. However, due to general weather fluctuations, higher up in the troposphere it is likely for there to be even a brief gust of wind. Normally, this doesn’t affect the rocket flight significantly.</p>
    

        <p>
            However, if the CP is too close to CG or too far from CG, this can occur. This can be measured by balancing the rocket on one’s finger (the location at which the rocket balances is the Center of Gravity), and using a simulation to determine the center of pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distance between the CP and CG (named the static margin) should ideally be the rocket diameter (referred to as 1 caliber).
        </p>
        <p>
            If the static margin is larger, the wind will cause the CP to swing around more, and result in the rocket moving too far.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the static margin is smaller, the wind will cause the CP to swing around, but it will also be harder for the rocket to return to its normal position, so the rocket will go slanted for a longer time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the designing of the rocket, however, this should have been fixed already. The issue occurs when the stability is changing, and parabolic flights have been occurring when they previously have not.
        </p>
        <p>
            This can be due to several factors; such as: shifting CG position (such as something sliding aft that is inside the rocket), a crooked fin (most likely), or fin flutter (where a rocket fin becomes deformed or broken).
        </p>
        
        <li>
            Is the rocket tilting in the same direction consistently?
        </li>
        <p>
            This can also be due to an incorrect installation of the motor mount tube. If the inner tube was slightly tilted (say that the centering ring was also slightly tilted, which caused the whole tube to point in a way that is not parallel to the rocket itself), it would result in a hard installation (which is recognizable. Then, the motor is still propelling the rocket horizontally as well as vertically, which would cause a squirrely flight.
        </p>
        
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Zigzag flights</h3>

<p>
    Generally, you can determine this based on the trail that the motor leaves behind. 
    This often occurs because the rocket repeatedly compensates for its weathercocking or swinging around, and thus the back of the rocket moves back and forth.
</p>

<p>
    If the rocket straightens out, this is good - the wind may have initially caused zig-zagging flights, but then the rocket is stable enough to right itself.
</p>

<p>
    If not, with the rocket going to the side or upside down (worst case), there is an issue with rocket stability or motor power. 
</p>

<p>
    The stability issue occurs because the oscillation is amplified - where normally, the center of pressure with a normal force perpendicular to the rocket will bring the line from CP to CG back to being perpendicular to the ground. However, when CP is in front of CG, this normal force will cause the rocket to move even further, and spiral out of control. 
</p>

<p>
    If this appears to be the issue, a fast way to test it on the ground is to run this CP and CG test.
</p>

<p>
    To fix this:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Add mass to the front of the rocket to bring the CG back in front</li>
    <li>Change the fin design - increasing the area will increase drag as well, and so the CP will move further backward. Note that this will also bring back the CG somewhat as well.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Horizontal Flights</h3>

<p>
    A missile was created! Congratulations!
</p>

<p>
    This has never happened to me, but it has happened to other teams that have launched rockets. 
    Some theories I have for why this happens are a combination of the following factors:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Weaker motors than necessary, as in the rocket is not powerful enough to continue going upwards and thus with enough mass and awkwardly placed CG/CPs, the rocket turns horizontal.</li>
    <li>Partial motor failure (as in it is pushing forward irregularly, or it does not burn all the way).</li>
    <li>Mis-aligned fin(s)</li>
    <li>Mis-aligned motor mount</li>
</ul>
