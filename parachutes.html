    <h2>Parachute Deployment</h2>
    <h3>Parachutes Deployed Before Apogee</h3>
    <p>This happens when the delay is too small. Running in RockSim/OpenRocket, look at the Simulation and identify the ‘Optimum Delay’ section. If this is larger than the delay (written on the motor. For example, F39-6T has a 6 second delay), then the rocket will deploy early.</p>
    <p><em>Do not think an F39-6T (3) has a 3 second delay! The 3 refers to the number of propellant kits in the reload package, so you can fly the rocket three times. The 6 is the time of the delay, because it precedes T.</em></p>
    <p>If the delay in RockSim/OpenRocket is very close to the delay of your rocket, then there are potential variabilities with the actual individual products that can be addressed - and since you can’t add back delay to an element, the best bet with these variable products is to just not use those delay elements.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, use a motor with a higher delay (for example, a F39-9T instead of a F39-6T) and then drill the motor down to the right number, or a bit more than the number mentioned by RockSim/OpenRocket, and then launch.</p>
    <p>To attempt to determine if your delay is going off early by about 50 feet, the distinctive “pop” sound of the motor causing parachute deployment will likely occur before you can see the nose cone in front of the fins.</p>
    <p>The rocket might also come apart at the launch rod itself, with the coupler being pulled out of the rocket. This is generally due to the motor being built incorrectly, such as with the absence of an o-ring or screw.</p>

    <h3>Parachutes Deployed At Apogee</h3>
    <p>Perfect! This is the ideal delay time.</p>
    <p>If you want your flight time to be lower, you can try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cutting spill holes into the parachutes</li>
        <li>Reefing the parachutes (placing tape on the parachute lines) so they open less</li>
        <li>Using parachutes with smaller diameters (so they don’t catch the air)</li>
        <li>Potentially picking a longer delay, but if the delay is too long, the rocket will turn into a ballistic missile speeding downwards, and the parachutes may eject too late or never.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Parachutes Deployed After Apogee</h3>
    <p>First, check the RockSim/OpenRocket sim to see if your delay is much longer than the desired amount for right after apogee.</p>
    <p>If the delay is clearly too late or too early, mass the delays and use a delay drill to move it down to the amount you want.</p>

    <h3>No Deployment</h3>
    <p>For this, the most likely cause is just a mistake in motor construction.</p>
    <p>For example, forgetting to drill the delay (a team from our school did this), and as a result, the rocket turned ballistic and hit the ground, crumpling the front half of the tube.</p>
    <p>However, if this happens, there will still be a pop sound from the rocket, just later.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, getting grease from the o-rings on the delay element could prevent the delay from getting ignited, causing a later deployment or none at all.</p>
    <p>If there is no popping sound, ever, it’s likely that there was an issue with the coupler fit. This could be due to humidity (and body tubes and couplers swelling in size) and being unable to pull apart. It could also be due to something like a piece of shock cord getting stuck between the transition and the body tube so that they hit each other and cannot be removed. It could also be due to the parachute cords getting stuck. To prevent this from happening, try this simple shaking test.</p>
