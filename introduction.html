    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the chill of winter weekends, with frozen fingers fumbling to tie together shock cord and build motors, I couldn’t be happier. Besides the coolness of launching flaming projectiles, I get the chance to design and build a model rocket from scratch. I also love spending time with my team, rallying us together and leading them to the Team America Rocketry Challenge Nationals several times. As I plot graphs of apogee vs rocket mass, or investigate different fin shapes on rocket simulators, I get to use my collective math and physics knowledge to experiment and work through the engineering design process. It often feels like I’m diagnosing the rocket for the reason for a varied apogee, and through the process, I have come up with a sort of guide for the problems I have encountered and their solutions.</p>
    <p>However, I would also like the knowledge I gained to be shared across a wider rocketry community. As a result, I made this guide and hope that other TARC teams can also benefit from this work! The guide is structured so that one can describe the details of their flights, and then refer to this guide to determine what might be the causes of the flights and how they could potentially fix them.</p>
